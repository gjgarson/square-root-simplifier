This is one of a bunch of small projects i did for fun, but lost the code for since i never had a github account until very recently.  
I actually made this during a geometry unit that was all about simplifying square roots (and some other stuff)  
but i found it really boring and repetitive, so i made this calculator to use on my homework
  
the code is really simple, and only took me like 30 mins to recreate (and improve), since i took a really brute force approach  
it just finds the nearest perfect square  
then checks every perfect square from there to see if it divides cleanly  
if it does, it will return the simplified number, otherwise, you cant simplify
